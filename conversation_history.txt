User: which one of the abvoe two courses are needed for a job in MNCs?
InsightAI (HTML): <p>Both Computer Science (CS) and Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) can be beneficial for a job in MNCs. However, the specific requirements may vary depending on the company and the role.</p>

<p>Typically, MNCs look for candidates with a strong foundation in computer science concepts, programming skills, and problem-solving abilities. CSE courses often provide a more practical and application-oriented approach, which can be beneficial for roles that involve system design, development, and implementation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, CS courses may provide a more theoretical foundation, which can be beneficial for roles that involve research, algorithm design, and software development.</p>

<p>That being said, many MNCs do not specifically require a CSE or CS degree. What they often look for is a strong understanding of computer science concepts, programming skills, and relevant experience.</p>

<p>Some of the top MNCs that hire CS and CSE graduates include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google</li>
  <li>Microsoft</li>
  <li>Amazon</li>
  <li>Facebook</li>
  <li>IBM</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, while both CS and CSE can be beneficial for a job in MNCs, it ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the company and the role. A strong foundation in computer science concepts, programming skills, and relevant experience are often more important than the specific degree.</p>
